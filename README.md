<h1>SpaceX  Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction</h1>
---

At this project, it is intended to explore the SpaceX records to determine how the payload mass, the orbit and even the launch area, among other various factors, can affect the success of the subsequent recovery of the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket. With the above It will be possible to parameterize and develop machine learning models, with which it will be possible, once the model that best fits the data under study has been determined, to predict whether a recovery mission for a Falcon 9 will be successful.
